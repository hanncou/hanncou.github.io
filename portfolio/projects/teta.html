        <h2>Teta Documentary</h2>
        <p>Web and Print Design / Photography and Marketing Material Design</p>

        <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> I joined the team of <a href="http://www.tetadocumentary.com">Teta</a>, a short film detailing <a href="http://www.alexandrahidalgo.com">Alexandra Hidalgo</a>‘s journey nursing her youngest son, just as filming was nearing an end. As it moved into post-production and submission to festivals, Teta needed a several materials designed to support it.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Team:</strong> Ten crew members in total, two of them designers</p>
        
        <p><strong>My Role:</strong> Photography, poster design, website design, photo editing, press kit design, dvd case design, social media banner design</p>
        
        <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> WordPress, CSS, DSLR camera, Adobe InDesign CC, Abode Illustrator CC, Adobe Photoshop CC</p>
        
        <p>I began by working concurrently on a visual identity for the <a href="#website" class="scroll">website</a> and <a href="#poster" class="scroll">poster</a>. I also designed the film's <a href="#press-kit" class="scroll">press kit</a> and a <a href="#dvd-case" class="scroll">DVD case and disc</a> for distribution. As the film progressed into the festival circuit, I created a set of <a href="#social-media" class="scroll">social media</a> banners to keep Teta's followers informed.</p>

        <!-- Website Content -->
        
        <h3 id="website">Website</h3>
        
        <p>To design the film website, I had the opportunity to work with stills and create graphic elements that would be repeated across the site, press kit, and other materials. I collaborated with Alex to choose colors and fonts consistent with the rhetorical message of the film and worked within WordPress to make the site a reality. This meant everything from color correcting stills to display on the site to organizing images into a footer graphic following the progression of the film.</p>

        <p>The process began by developing a simple outline for how the site should look. Once I had a basic idea of what we wanted out of the site, I created a wireframe.</p>
        
        <figure class="img-wrapper">
            <img src="../images/teta-01.png" alt="A wireframe illustrating the location of a banner image, centered top nav, and primary content."/>
            <figcaption>Initial wireframe for the website.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p>After that, we set in on hashing out the design details of the site. Because my client had websites made for previous films, she knew what she wanted the information architecture to look like. Color schemes, fonts, and visual elements were my job.</p>
        
        <figure class="img-wrapper">
            <img src="../images/teta-02.png" alt="A color scheme with browns, blues and greens."/>
            <figcaption>We developed a color scheme with shades and tints of our main brown, blue and green.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <figure class="img-wrapper">
            <img src="../images/teta-03.png" alt="A mother nurses her youngest child in bed with her older boy cuddled close to them. 'Teta; a nursing mother tells her story' is written out."/>
            <figcaption>Our banner image was composed using a still from the film and a shade of blue from our color scheme.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <figure class="img-wrapper">
            <img src="../images/teta-04.png" alt="Six small square photos tilted against each other each show a young boy nursing."/>
            <figcaption>The footer on each page is a collection of stills from the film that show Santiago nursing as a newborn up until he is almost done.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        
        <!-- Poster Content -->
        
        <h3 id="poster">Poster</h3>
        
        <p>On a brisk March day I shot the principal photography to use for the poster design. We had a plan, so we headed to a location that fit the idea for the poster.</p>
        
        <figure class="img-wrapper">
            <img src="../images/teta-05.png" alt="Three photographs of a mother sitting on a boardwalk nursing her young child while her older boy plays nearby."/>
            <figcaption>We narrowed down the photos to the three that best represented the film, then worked from there.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p>After I reviewed and edited the photographs in Photoshop Camera Raw, we chose our top three to work with. From here, I worked together with my client to consider a tagline and a set of fonts to use within the design and tested them out in InDesign.</p>
        
        <figure class="img-wrapper">
            <img src="../images/teta-06.png" alt="Four images of the headline 'Teta; a film by Alexandra Hidalgo' in different fonts. Two include the tagline 'a nursing mother tells her story,' two do not."/>
            <figcaption>Selecting the fonts and whether or not to use a tagline was an important part of crafting the film's image.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p>Once these details were settled on, I pulled the headline section into Illustrator and saved it as an asset in CC Libraries. I knew we would need posters at different dimensions and other future content that I could design more efficiently without having to resize and reorganize the headline every time. I did the same for other pieces of graphic content, such as the production company logo and the credit block. With everything in place for the next steps, the final poster could now be composed.</p>
        
        <figure class="img-wrapper">
            <img src="../images/teta-07.png" alt="A nursing mother tells her story; Teta; a film by Alexandra Hidalgo. On an early spring day, a mother nurses her young son on a boardwalk and her oldest runs down the walk towards them."/>
            <figcaption>The final poster.</figcaption>

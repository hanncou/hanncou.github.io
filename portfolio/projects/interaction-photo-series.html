        <h2>Photo Series: Interaction and Signage</h2>
        <p>Photography and Photo Editing / Document Design</p>

        <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> During the five weeks I spent studying photography in England and France, I had the opportunity to look at the cities, people, project and medium through eyes that were trained to look at user experience and the ways we interact with our surroundings.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Team:</strong> While this was a solo project, my professor and five other students frequently critiqued each other's work and offered suggestions for improvement.</p>
        
        <p><strong>My Role:</strong> Photography, exploration, photo editing, document design, exhibit design</p>
        
        <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Canon T3i DSLR camera, Adobe Photoshop CC, Adobe InDesign CC, Adobe Bridge CC</p>
        
        <p><strong>Deliverables:</strong> Digital photos, physical exhibit</p>
        
        <p>After spending time exploring the cities I was in and capturing countless scenes, I curated and edited my photos into the <a href="#digital" class="scroll">digital images</a> that can be viewed below. When thinking about how to show them, it seemed only natural to encourage the type of interaction I had been photographing through the design of the <a href="#gallery" class="scroll">gallery exhibit</a>.</p>

        <p>I wanted to incorporate my outsider’s perspective, my interest in print design, and a little of my own sense of humor. That’s why I chose to display my photographs as postcards, both large and meant to be flipped through and small and meant to be browsed or taken. I wanted my project to be experienced; a reflection of how I often felt experiencing these new environments.</p>
        
        <figure class="img-wrapper">
            <img src="../images/interaction-01.jpg" alt="Eight by ten inch images stick out from the wall, able to be flipped through and experienced. A rotating postcard rack sits on a stand nearby, holding small versions of the same postcards."/>
            <figcaption>Postcards in the exhibition to be browsed, held and taken.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <h4>Artist's Statement: untitled / sans titre</h4>
        
        <p>From any angle, you can see people and objects interacting within a space. For me, the five weeks I was abroad were spent exploring and understanding a space that was foreign to me. To look at things from the outside provided a unique perspective to notice the interactions occurring between people, objects and the environment.</p>

        <p>There are countless little moments when you look at something just right and the completely mundane becomes a scene worth laughing at or remembering. Often these moments are fleeting and captured in the blink of an eye; this project is an effort to instead capture them with the clicking of a shutter.</p>

        <p>I’d like to share all these brief little coincidences of people and objects interacting with the space around them. These are not things millions of people have seen with their own eyes. They are not the instantly recognizable scenes normally found on postcards. They are moments from my time abroad where I noticed regular people existing within a space that made them special. These are the moments I would like to send back home.</p>

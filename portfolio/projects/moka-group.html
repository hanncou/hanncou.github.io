        <h2>Moka Group</h2>
        <p>UX, Web and Print Design / Photography and Content Creation</p>

        <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Moka and the Starlight Lounge, two intertwined businesses in a small town, faced a identity crisis. Despite being in the same building and owned and operated by the same people, patrons were often confused about how connected the two were. I sought to draw the connection between businesses and resolve questions guests often posed with my designs, creating a smooth experience for anyone visiting the restaurant physically or digitally.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Team:</strong> One UX designer, later joined by one marketing specialist</p>
        
        <p><strong>My Role:</strong> Interviewing, contextual inquiry, user research, wireframing, mockups, interaction design, information design, service design, print design, social media and marketing strategy, content creation, administrative document design</p>
        
        <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Adobe XD, WordPress, CSS, Adobe Illustrator CC, Adobe InDesign CC, Adobe Photoshop CC, Canon Rebel t3i DSLR camera</p>
        
        <p>On the consumer-facing end, I revamped the <a href="#website" class="scroll">website</a>, created <a href="#marketing" class="scroll">marketing materials</a> and a <a href="#social-media" class="scroll">social media strategy</a>, and redesigned the <a href="#menu" class="scroll">menus</a> to visually unify a dual-business and convey its information. I also crafted <a href="#documents" class="scroll">administrative documents</a> to streamline processes employees noted were inconsistent.</p>

        <!-- Website Content -->
        
        <h3 id="website">Website</h3>
        <p>Moka’s website was in need of a redesign and some slimming down. After breaking down the information architecture and cataloging which pages are linked from the homepage and how many times, I set to work simplifying the structure and designing a new website.</p>
        
        <figure class="img-wrapper">
            <img src="../images/moka-01.png" alt="Screenshot of a restaurant website with a horizontal navigation, logo reading 'moka,' and a slider image with a pastry case and text that reads, 'Baked goods made daily!' alongside a window with a plaintext document full of notes."/>
            <figcaption>Cataloguing and making sense of the existing content.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p>I spent time looking at what tasks were most important for users to accomplish quickly and easily on a restaurant’s website. By asking restaurant goers what they usually were looking for when they checked the location’s website I developed an understanding of what users’ goals and priorities usually looked like.</p>
        
        <figure class="img-wrapper">
            <img src="../images/moka-02.png" alt="An image of a user with tasks flowing from basic 'looking for menu' and 'checking the hours' to 'looking for specific information (health concerns, etc.)' and 'calling for availability.'"/>
            <figcaption>Diagram showing users' priorities when they visit a site, based on guerilla interviews of Moka's clientele.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p>I did a competitive analysis to see how other establishments with similar customer bases addressed those needs, then began mocking up the website. I chose to design wireframes for most of the pages by pulling content directly from the menu design and current website, but created more comprehensive mockups for the landing page, which has a lot of visual weight and is the most drastic part of the redesign. Quality photography on a restaurant’s website can whet users’ appetites and urge them to visit, so I made a full browser width image slider the highlight of the landing page.</p>
        
        <figure class="img-wrapper">
            <img src="../images/moka-03.png" alt="A screenshot of artboards in Adobe XD. While the landing page uses images to visualize a sliding banner, most screens are colorless and function as wireframes."/>
            <figcaption>Most of my artboards in Adobe XD acted as wireframes rather than high-fidelity comps. I used the tool to plan the organization of content and the user interactions rather than to create a picture-perfect prototype.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p>I took notes alongside my design and kept the original website in an artboard to look back on whenever necessary. Once I’d filled in the design and some content for each page, I used Adobe XD to create a prototype to show to my client and other stakeholders. It can be viewed and interacted with below, or <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/89d26938-fba9-44b5-a2f4-7a0a65103feb/">at this site</a>.</p>
        
    </div>
        
        <div class="prototype-wrapper">
            <iframe width="1922" height="1080" src="https://xd.adobe.com/embed/89d26938-fba9-44b5-a2f4-7a0a65103feb/" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
        
    <div class="case-study-wrapper">
        
        <p>After testing the prototype with Moka patrons and my client, I had some valuable feedback with which to make modifications. Most users seemed happy with the design concepts, but were concerned that there was no Facebook feed, where the night’s specials are primarily communicated. Because of this input I included a sidebar on every page that contains the Facebook feed. I also included a link to Facebook within the main navigation, highlighting its prominence.</p>
        
        <figure class="img-wrapper">
            <img src="../images/moka-04.png" alt="A webpage with a full-screen photo of a view from inside the building and a top navigation. It contains information about hours and location as well as a Facebook feed sidebar below."/>

        </figure>
        
        <p>I shot some new photos of the restaurant, using a wide angle lens at a quieter part of the day to offer an uncluttered view of the dining room and its location in the heart of Bellaire, and also used shots of sandwiches, coffee, and Moka’s famous quiche to top off the design.</p>

        <h3 id="marketing">Marketing</h3>
        <p>Show social pages, Tonight's Specials banner and daily images, talk about social media strategy, show flyer and order form for the Bee Well thing, etc, etc.</p>

        <h3 id="social-media">Social Media Strategy</h3>
        <p>Moka and Starlight's Facebook page profile pictures, banners, and strategy for content. I created graphics to post with specials and used photographs to whet appetites about dishes. Also, I set up a campaign to encourage followers to try Italian Sodas in a handful of new flavors during Bellaire's Rubber Ducky Festival.</p>
        
        
        <!-- Menu Content -->
        
        <h3 id="menu">Menu</h3>
        <p>The menu went through several stages. Keeping in communication with the client, I learned about restrictions as I updated her on the design.</p>
        
        <figure class="img-wrapper">

        <!-- To-Go Menu Content -->
        
        <h3>To-Go Menu</h3>
        <p>Reflecting the new menu design, I also put together a to-go menu for Moka. Because my client found that most of the restaurant’s to-go orders came during the day and didn’t want to ask the kitchen to prepare both menus when Starlight didn’t officially open until the afternoon, the Starlight menu isn’t featured here. While maintaining the same font and hierarchy scheme found in the full menu, I put more emphasis on simplicity in this design and used a two column layout with solid lines. I also chose not to repeat the grey header bars here, avoiding too much complexity in a small handout menu. The final design is meant to be printed double-sided on a standard 8.5×11 sheet of paper, then folded in half hamburger-style.</p>

        <!-- Administrative Documents Content -->
        
        <h3 id="documents">Administrative Documents</h3>
        <p>The customer experience isn't the only one that design can lend a hand to. Working closely with the Moka / Starlight crew, I heard some of their grievances about internal systems and processes.</p>
        
        <p>One major issue that came up was inconsistency in how the till was counted each night. I interviewed the two openers of the restaurant and recorded their ideas about how everything should be counted and documented. I also had conversations with closers to see how they currently counted the till in order to make sure my design felt intuitive and clear.</p>
